![PERMA](perma-model-e1615246676966-2.webp)

The PERMA-Profiler offers a comprehensive view of your wellbeing across five key areas: Positive emotion, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, and Accomplishment. Here's how to approach your results and take action, based on scientific research:

1. **View your profile holistically:** Your wellbeing is multifaceted. Look at how you're doing across all domains, not just overall.

2. **Identify strengths and areas for growth:** Your visual profile highlights where you're thriving and where there might be room for improvement.

3. **Avoid judgement:** There's no "perfect" profile. Your results are information, not a grade.

4. **Consider context:** Your age, gender, culture, and current life circumstances all influence your wellbeing profile.

5. **Track changes over time:** Retake the test periodically to see how your wellbeing evolves.

6. **Focus on specific domains:** If you notice an area that's lower, consider targeted actions to boost that aspect of your wellbeing.

7. **Recognize connections:** Improving one area often positively impacts others.

8. **Balance positives and negatives:** While focusing on positive aspects, acknowledge that negative emotions and experiences are also part of life.

9. **Set realistic goals:** Use your results to inform personal development goals, but be patient and realistic about change.

10. **Seek support:** If you identify areas where you're struggling, don't hesitate to seek professional help or support from loved ones.

Remember, the PERMA-Profiler is a tool for self-reflection and growth. Use your results as a starting point for enhancing your overall wellbeing and creating a more fulfilling life.
